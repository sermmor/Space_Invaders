# Space Invaders
## What is it?
This was the first videogame that I did. This is a classic Space Invaders videogame without any graphic motor (and without sound), this only use default Java libraries.

## Controls
You can control the spaceship pushing keyboard arrows right and left, and you attack pushing spacebar.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: I finished this project in May 2013, and I won't do an update of this anymore.
