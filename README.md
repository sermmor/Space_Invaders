# Space Invaders
## What is it?
This was the first videogame that I did. This is a classic Space Invaders videogame without any graphic motor (and without sound), this only use default Java libraries.

## Controls
You can control the spaceship pushing keyboard arrows right and left, and you attack pushing spacebar.

## Executable
You can download a executable file of the game in [itch.io](https://sermmor.itch.io/simple-space-invaders)
